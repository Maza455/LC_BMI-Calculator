# LC_BMI-Calculator

A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that estimates the amount of body fat based on a person's height and weight.
It is used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.
BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms (or pounds) by the square of height in meters (or feet).
The formula for BMI is: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2 or weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703.
The result is then compared to a chart that summarizes how the BMI results can be generally interpreted.
The optimum range for a healthy BMI is considered to be 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while a BMI of 30 or greater is considered obese.
It is important to note that BMI is not always an accurate representation of body fatness, and it is not the sole determiner of one's general health.
